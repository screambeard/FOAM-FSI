FOAM-FSI
========

Features
-----------

* Partitioned Fluid-Structure Interaction solvers build with standard foam-extend fluid and solid solvers.
* Algorithms for strongly coupled FSI: Aitken under relaxation, IQN-ILS or Anderson acceleration, manifold mapping acceleration, and space mapping acceleration.
* Consistent first and second order time integration schemes for incompressible flow, structural dynamics and FSI.
* Efficient implementation of mesh motion solver based on radial basis function interpolation.
* Run fluid-structure-acoustics simulations with the coupling tool preCICE.
* Block-coupled transient incompressible flow solver.
* Arbitrary high order time discretization for incompressible flow solver based on the PIMPLE algorithm.

Installation
-----------

First, compile `foam-extend-3.1`, the `nextRelease` branch. A detailed description for the compilation of `foam-extend-3.1` can be found here: https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation/Linux/foam-extend-3.1. Note that FOAM-FSI uses the `nextRelease` branch as shown below:

``` bash
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openfoam-extend/foam-extend-3.1
cd foam-extend-3.1
git checkout nextRelease
./Allwmake.firstInstall
```

To compile the FSI library:

``` bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/davidsblom/FOAM-FSI.git
cd FOAM-FSI
./Allwmake.firstInstall
```

The first time the library is compiled, use the `Allwmake_firstInstall` script which installs the necessary settings in `foam-extend-3.1/etc/prefs.sh`, and compiles several third party packages. Thereafter, you can use the `Allwmake` script.

Prerequisites
-----------

gcc 4.8 or higher due to C++11 features.

Test suite
-----------

A test suite is available implementing a large number of unit and functional tests within the googletest framework. In case you run into problems with the FSI solver, preferably run the test suite and attach a log of the test results to your bug report.
To run the test suite:
``` bash
tests
```
