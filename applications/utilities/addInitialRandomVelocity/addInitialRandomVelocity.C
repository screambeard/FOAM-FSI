Application
    applyBoundaryLayer

Description
    Apply a simplified boundary-layer model to the velocity and
    turbulence fields based on the 1/7th power-law.

    The uniform boundary-layer thickness is either provided via the -ybl option
    or calculated as the average of the distance to the wall scaled with
    the thickness coefficient supplied via the option -Cbl.  If both options
    are provided -ybl is used.
