These cases are for validation of time consistency in foam-extend-3.1 with the new solver setup and new schemes (bdf1, bdf2, bdf3)

static:
    Case where mesh is static.

moving:
    Cases where the mesh is moving, which requires the new Uf variable to be present in the solver (such that is can be used by the ddtSchemes).
    expandingRotatingMesh:
        Case where rotation (of the whole mesh) and expansion of the mesh can be controlled and tested. Done such that bdf2area and bdf2nor can be tested. Purely done for analysis.
    movingBody:
        Case where the inner body is moving by a prescribed motion. Deformation is done by RBF.

fsi:
    Case where a (non-linear) 3DoF rigid body is used and coupled to the fluid solver.

relaxation:
    Cases where it is shown that with under-relaxation still time consistency can be achieved and the solution is independent of the relaxation factor (when converged).
    For the static cases also the "old" approach is given, with the old solver, to show what happened when relaxation influenced the order.
